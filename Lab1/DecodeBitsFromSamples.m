function rec_bit_seq = DecodeBitsFromSamples(rec_sample_seq,case_type,fs)
%
% Inputs:
%   rec_sample_seq: The input sample sequence to the channel
%   case_type:      The sampling frequency used to generate the sample sequence
%   fs:             The bit flipping probability
% Outputs:
%   rec_sample_seq: The sequence of sample sequence after passing through the channel
%
% This function takes the sample sequence after passing through the
% channel, and decodes from it the sequence of bits based on the considered
% case and the sampling frequence
